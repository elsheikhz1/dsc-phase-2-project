# Phase 2 Project



## Project Overview

For this project, you will use regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.

It is up to you to decide what data from this dataset to use and how to use it. If you are feeling overwhelmed or behind, we recommend you ignore some or all of the following features:

* date
* view
* sqft_above
* sqft_basement
* yr_renovated
* zipcode
* lat
* long
* sqft_living15
* sqft_lot15

### Business Problem
The stakeholder for this project is a real estate agency specializing in assisting homeowners with buying and selling properties. The agency faces a business problem wherein they need to offer guidance to homeowners regarding home renovations. Specifically, they need to provide advice on how certain renovations can enhance the estimated value of a home and determine the extent of the value increase. By addressing this business problem, the agency can empower homeowners with valuable insights and recommendations to make informed decisions about renovations and potentially maximize their property's value in the market.

By conducting three iterations of analysis, the project aims to refine the insights and recommendations provided to homeowners. The ultimate goal is to empower homeowners to make informed decisions about renovations and potentially maximize their property's value in the market.

Additional Resources
In addition to the data and column descriptions, a presentation slides document is also available to provide a concise overview of the project's findings and recommendations.
